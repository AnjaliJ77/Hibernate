Inheritance in hibernate
1. Single table
2. Joined 
3. table per class



1. Single Table:
All parent and child classes are stored in ONE database table.

Hibernate adds a discriminator column to identify which row belongs to which class.
STRATEGY
One table for all classes
Uses Discriminator column
Some columns will be NULL


2. Joined
Each class has its own table
👉 Parent table stores common fields
👉 Child tables store specific fields
👉 All tables are linked using PRIMARY KEY + FOREIGN KEY

Hibernate uses JOINs when fetching data.
When should you use JOINED?
✔ Clean database design
✔ No NULL columns
✔ Easy to understand DB
❌ Slightly slower than Single Table (because of JOINs)


3. Table Per Class
Table Per Class is an inheritance mapping strategy where:
Each concrete class has its own table
Parent class does NOT have a table
Subclass tables contain all fields, including inherited fields

Use when:

Each subclass is independent
You rarely query the parent class
You want no joins between tables

❌ Avoid when:
You frequently query the base class
Large number of subclasses (performance issue)


@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public abstract class Payment {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;
    private double amount;



Child class
@Entity
public class CreditCardPayment extends Payment {
    private String cardNumber;
}

“In TABLE_PER_CLASS inheritance, neither @DiscriminatorColumn nor @JoinColumn is required because each subclass has its own independent table.”
