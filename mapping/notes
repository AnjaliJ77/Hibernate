Mapping:
It establish the connection b/w two entity class.

1 to many: 1 company can have many employees
many to one: many employees have one company
1 to 1: one person can have one laptop
many to many: multiple ppl can read multiple books


1 to 1
One-to-One mapping means one row in a table is associated with exactly one row in another table.
owner and pet: owner will be the source 
in owner we should create pet variable private pet pet; and getter and setter.
In owner only we should have FK: @OneToOne(mappedBy="Ownerclass")
@joinColumn(name="pet_id, referencedColumnName="id"))


In Pet class:

@OneToOne(cascade=casescadeType.All)
@joinColumn(name=wonerid");   FK
private Ownerid ownerid;
